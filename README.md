## Notes
- Variables are of type `long long int`; suitable for large integers.  
- Division is integer division: `7 / 2` â†’ `3`.  
- In case of division by zero: `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`  
- If an invalid operation is entered: `Error: Invalid operation.`

## Tips
- If you want a decimal result, you can set the `number1`, `number2`, and `sum` variables to `double`.  
- You can add a `cin.fail()` check for input validation.
